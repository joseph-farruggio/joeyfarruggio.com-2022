I’ve was struggling with page speed issues on my WordPress website after adding a chatbot. To fix that problem I created [Chatbot Lazy Loader](https://wordpress.org/plugins/chatbot-lazy-loader/), a WordPress plugin that eliminates the page speed issues created by chatbots.

If your website is loading a chatbot widget, it’s likely negatively impacting your page speed. This plugin will prevent that for the following chatbot providers:

- Messenger
- Drift
- Intercom
- Indemandly
- Crisp

If there are any questions or feedback, or if you have a chatbot provider you’d like this plugin to support comment below.
